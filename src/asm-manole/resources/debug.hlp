DEBUG                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      DEBUG

Purpose:     Used to test, patch and disassemble executable files.

Use:         This  tool is the  MSX-DOS  port  of the  original tool
             that was delivered with MS-DOS.
	     Differences mainly consist in MSX  different  platform,
	     using Z80-R800 cpu instead of intel x86 for IBM pc.

	     Here some usage  information  for this  tool. For  more
	     details, type '?' in command line.


	     IMPORTANT
	     All numbers in this tool are always interpreted as hex.


	     LOADING EXECUTABLE
	     First use command 'N' to specify the name of your file.

		Example: N test.com

             Then use command 'L' to load it. If you  need  you  can
             specify the starting address, setting  it as  argument.
             Default value is 0100.

             This  value  will be  stored  to  'HL' debug  register.

             In 'BC' register there will be stored the size of  your
             file.

             The software will not allow to load files  to addresses
             less  than  100h and remember that your program  should
	     NOT  overwrite same tool's space  to  avoid  unexpected
	     crash! (see 'Free TPA' information typing '?').


	     SAVING EXECUTABLE
	     To save program in  memory to a  file,  use 'W' command.
	     Argument is optional and is used to specify the starting
	     address. (will be stored to 'HL' register)

	     'BC' register will be used for size. If you loaded  this
	     file with  'L'  command,  you  will  already  have  this
	     register set.

	     If you need to specify size manually, use 'R' command.

		Example: R BC A

	     Register value will be 10.

	     ASSEMBLE
	     With the command 'A' you  can  write  manually  Z80-R800
	     assembly code!
	     Default address is 0100h but you can manually set  it as
	     argument.

		Example: A 200

	     Your code will be assembled starting from 0200 address.

	     For commands like LD r,r / IN A,(C) / OUT (C),A remember
	     that you need to write LD A,B with 'B' as  register  and
	     LD A,0B with '0B' as hex number.
	     The same for IN and OUT, (C) to specify C  register  and
	     (0C) to specify C as hex number.  Excluding  this  case,
	     generally you don't  need to write all  digits  for  hex
	     numbers.
	     For example it is enough  you write '10'  for  0010 word
	     number.

	     CPUMODE
	     With  '#'  command  you  can  set cpu mode for your MSX.
	     This command can be used only for MSX turboR.
	     Arguments:
	     '0' for mode Z80;
	     '1' for mode R800 ROM;
	     '2' for mode R800 RAM;

	     SCRIPTING
	     DEBUG.COM can be used also with a  scripting input file.

		Example: DEBUG < SCRIPT.TXT

		SCRIPT.TXT
		----------
		a 100
		ld a,2
		la hl,1234
		ret
		r bc 6
		n test.com
		w
		q

	     This script will assemble a small program and save it  as
	     'TEST.COM' and finally closes DEBUG.

Examples:

        DEBUG
        ?

             Writes a summary of all available commands.
